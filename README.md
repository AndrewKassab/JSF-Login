# JSF - Login 

This is a sample application to demonstrate knowledge with JSF, Spring, and Hibernate. I have utilized these three frameworks in conjuction with 
Tomcat 9.0, Java 15, and MySQL to create a working login form. To get to the welcome screen, you must provide valid credentials. The credentials must 
exist in the user table of the jsf_login database on your local instance of MySQL. A helper database script is provided in resources to set up your db.

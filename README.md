# JSF - Login 

This is a sample application to demonstrate knowledge with JSF, Spring, and Hibernate. 

I have utilized these three frameworks in conjuction with Tomcat 9.0, Java 15, and MySQL to create a working login form. 

To get to the welcome screen, you must provide valid credentials which already exist in the User table of the database. 
Under resources, there is a sql script which will set up the database for the application.
